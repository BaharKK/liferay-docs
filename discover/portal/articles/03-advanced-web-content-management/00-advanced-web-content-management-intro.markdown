# Advanced Web Content Management [](id=advanced-web-content-management)

In the previous chapter you learned some basic ways you can use Liferay to
handle your web content. In this chapter you'll delve deeper into slightly more
complex web content management techniques. But don't be alarmed, it's not too
intense. We'll cover the following topics:

- Web content structures and templates
- RSS Feeds
- Site templates and page templates
- Localization
- Allowing users to customize site pages
- Scheduling Web Content
- Staging
- Creating teams to allow for flexible management of site permissions
- Mobile device rules
- Monitoring with Google Analytics

You'll examine how web content structures and templates provide additional power
and flexibility to the web content management system you saw previously. You'll
also learn how easy it is to set up and administer multiple sites in Liferay.
Next, we'll learn how you can empower your users to create personal
customizations of site pages. You'll also examine how you can use staging to
manage the publication of pages and content on your site. You'll conclude with
sections on creating teams and rules for presenting site pages to mobile
devices.
