In this chapter, you learned how to use Liferay's Audience Targeting app. This
app allows you to define custom user segments, target specific content to
different user segments, and create campaigns for different user segments.
Liferay's Audience Targeting app allows you generate reports so that you can
measure the effectiveness of your campaigns. Liferay's Audience Targeting app
also includes a simulator so that you can preview how your site would appear to
users belonging to different user segments. You can create user segments by
applying various rules that reference session attributes, profile attributes,
behavior, and possibly other information, such as information from social
networks. It's also easy for developers to create additional rules and rule
types.
