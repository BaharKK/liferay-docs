# Monitoring [](id=monitoring)

The last link in the Users section of the Control Panel is for monitoring. You
can use the Monitoring page to view all of the live sessions in the portal. For
performance reasons, this setting is usually turned off in production. 

Another way of seeing what users are doing is to install the Audit plugin from
[Liferay Marketplace](https://www.liferay.com/marketplace). You'll learn how to
use that next.
